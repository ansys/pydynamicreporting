Overview
--------
PyDynamicReporting is the Python client library for Ansys Dynamic Reporting,
previously documented as `Nexus`_. Ansys Dynamic Reporting is a service for
pushing items of many types, including images, text, 3D scenes, and tables,
into a database, where you can keep them organized and create dynamic reports
from them. When you use PyDynamicReporting to connect to an instance of
Ansys Dynamic Reporting, you have a Pythonic way of accessing all capabilities
of Ansys Dynamic Reporting.

Documentation and issues
------------------------
Documentation for the latest stable release of PyDynamicReporting is hosted at
`PyDynamicReporting documentation <https://dynamicreporting.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/>`_.

In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an option
for switching from viewing the documentation for the latest stable release
to viewing the documentation for the development version or previously
released versions.

You can also `view <https://cheatsheets.docs.pyansys.com/pydynamicreporting_cheat_sheet.png>`_ or
`download <https://cheatsheets.docs.pyansys.com/pydynamicreporting_cheat_sheet.pdf>`_ the
PyDynamicReporting cheat sheet. This one-page reference provides syntax rules and commands
for using PyDynamicReporting.

On the `PyDynamicReporting Issues <https://github.com/ansys/pydynamicreporting/issues>`_
page, you can create issues to report bugs and request new features. On the `Discussions <https://discuss.ansys.com/>`_
page on the Ansys Developer portal, you can post questions, share ideas, and get community feedback.

To reach the project support team, email `pyansys.core@ansys.com <pyansys.core@ansys.com>`_.

Installation
------------
The ``pydynamicreporting`` package supports Python 3.10 through 3.12 on
Windows and Linux. It is currently available on the PyPi
`repository <https://pypi.org/project/ansys-dynamicreporting-core/>`_.

To install the package, simply run

.. code::

   pip install ansys-dynamicreporting-core

Developer installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To clone and install the ``pydynamicreporting`` package in development mode,
run this code:

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/ansys/pydynamicreporting
   cd pydynamicreporting
   pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv  # create virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # (.\venv\Scripts\activate for Windows shell)
   make install-dev  # install pydynamicreporting in editable mode

The preceding code creates an "editable" installation that lets you develop and test
PyDynamicReporting at the same time.

To build and create a production-like installation on Windows (not required on other OSes),
first install `chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/install>`_. Then:

.. code::

   choco install make  # install make on Windows
   make clean  # clean
   make build   # build
   # this replaces the editable installation done previously. If you don't want to replace,
   # switch your virtual environments to test the new install separately.
   make install
   # you can skip the steps above and just do 'make all'
   make smoketest  # test import

Local GitHub Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To run GitHub Actions on your local desktop (recommended), install the
`act <https://github.com/nektos/act#readme>`_ package.

.. code::

   choco install act-cli

To run a job, such as the ``style`` job from the ``ci_cd.yml`` file, use
this command, where ``style`` is the job name:

.. code::

   act -W '.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml' -j style --bind


Deploy and upload steps **must always** be ignored. If they are not ignored,
before running GitHub Actions locally, add ``if: ${{ !env.ACT }}`` to the
workflow step and commit this change if required.

Creating a Release
------------------

This project now uses **tag-driven releases** and **dynamic versions** powered by ``hatch-timestamp-version`` (based on ``hatch-vcs``). Stable releases are cut from **Git tags** (``vX.Y.Z``). Development builds use **UTC timestamped** versions derived from the most recent tag.
**Release branches are no longer needed**; the version is always derived from tags.

Versioning model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Stable releases**: The version is the exact **Git tag** (for example, ``v0.10.0`` → package version ``0.10.0``).
- **Development builds**: Version is computed from the latest tag **plus a timestamp**, e.g. ``0.10.1.devYYYYMMDDHHMMSS``.
- No manual editing of ``pyproject.toml`` for versions — ``[tool.hatch.version]`` drives everything.

What the automation does
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Create Draft Release** (on tag push): builds wheels/sdist and opens a **draft GitHub Release** attaching artifacts.
- **Publish Release** (when the GitHub Release is **published**): uploads artifacts to **PyPI** via Trusted Publisher, then builds & deploys **stable docs**.
- **Failure notifications**: posts to Microsoft Teams on workflow failure.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Ensure ``CHANGELOG.md`` has a section for the release **dated today** (the helper script validates this).
- Working tree must be **clean** (no uncommitted changes).
- CI secrets for publishing and docs deploy are configured in GitHub.

Cutting a Stable Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Make sure your ``CHANGELOG.md`` entry for the version is dated **today**
   (this check runs automatically from ``make tag``).

2) Create and push the release tag:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make tag

   This runs all safety checks, validates the changelog date, and pushes the Git tag (for example, ``v0.10.0``).

3) Once the tag is pushed:
   - The **Create Draft Release** workflow builds the package and opens a **draft GitHub Release** with artifacts.
   - After reviewing and finalizing notes, **publish** the GitHub Release.

4) Publishing the release automatically triggers the **Release** workflow, which:
   - Uploads artifacts to **PyPI** using Trusted Publisher.
   - Builds and deploys the **stable documentation**.

Patch releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- For a patch, update the changelog, ensure the working tree is clean, then run ``make tag`` again (which tags the next patch version determined by ``hatch version`` from your last tag).
- No separate “release branch” is required; the version is derived from tags.

Local dry-runs (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can use ``act`` to exercise non-publishing parts locally. Steps that publish or deploy are already guarded in workflows (e.g., with ``if: ${{ !env.ACT }}``). Build and validation steps still run:

.. code-block:: bash

   act -W '.github/workflows/release.yml' -j release --bind

CI workflows (reference)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **.github/workflows/create_draft_release.yml**
  - Triggers on: tag push ``v*``, or manual dispatch.
  - Builds artifacts and opens a **draft** GitHub Release attaching ``dist/*``.

- **.github/workflows/release.yml**
  - Triggers on: **published** GitHub Release, or manual dispatch.
  - Rebuilds/validates, downloads artifacts, **publishes to PyPI**, builds docs, and **deploys stable docs**.

CLI helpers
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Print the resolved version (dev or stable):

  .. code-block:: bash

     make version

- Build locally (sdist + wheel):

  .. code-block:: bash

     make build
     make check-dist

- Clean:

  .. code-block:: bash

     make clean

Changelog guards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Releases are blocked if today’s dated entry is missing:

.. code-block:: text

   ❌ ERROR: CHANGELOG.md is not ready for release.
      Expected line: ## [0.10.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
      Tip: Check if it's still marked as '[Unreleased]' and update it to today's date.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **“No Git tag found” during checks**: Create a tag via ``make tag`` (or ``git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z``).
- **Draft already exists**: The draft release is unique per tag. Delete or publish the existing one, or bump the tag properly.
- **Version mismatch**: ``hatch version`` determines the version from the last tag; ensure you pushed the intended tag and your clone has all tags (``git fetch --tags``).


Dependencies

    >>> adr_service = adr.Service(ansys_installation=r"C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v232")
    >>> ret = adr_service.connect()
    >>> my_img = adr_service.create_item()
