Contributing
############

We absolutely welcome any code contributions and we hope that this
guide will facilitate an understanding of the ``pydynamicreporting`` code
repository. It is important to note that while the ``pydynamicreporting``
software package is maintained by ANSYS and any submissions will be
reviewed thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community
that can support user questions and develop new features to make this
software a useful tool for all users.  As such, we welcome and encourage
any questions or submissions to this repository.

Please reference the `PyAnsys Developer's Guide <https://dev.docs.pyansys.com/>`_ for the full documentation
regarding contributing to the ``pydynamicreporting`` project.

- **`feat`**  any changes that introduce a new feature or significant addition
- **`junk`**  for any experimental changes that can be deleted if gone stale
- **`maint`**  for general maintenance of the repository or CI routines
- **`doc`**  for any changes only pertaining to documentation
- **`no-ci`**  for low-impact activity that should not trigger the CI routines
- **`testing`**  Improvements or changes to testing
- **`release`**  Releases
