Launching the Ansys Dynamic Reporting Service
=============================================

To launch the service, provide an Ansys installation directory as a string.
You can provide an existing, empty, directory if you intend to create a database.

.. note::
   This example assumes that you have a local Ansys installation.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-23

.. code-block:: Python


    import ansys.dynamicreporting.core as adr

    db_dir = "C:\\tmp\\my_local_db_directory"
    ansys_ins = "C:\\Program Files\\Ansys Inc\\v241"

    adr_service = adr.Service(ansys_installation=ansys_ins, db_directory=db_dir)



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-29

Starting the Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once a `Service` object has been created, it must be started. It can be
similarly stopped.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-35

.. code-block:: Python


    session_guid = adr_service.start(create_db=True)

    # To stop the service
    adr_service.stop()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-45

Connecting to a remote Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may need to connect to a service that is already running. To do so create
a Service object, as before, but leave off the database argument and this time,
call the `connect` method and provide connection details, including any
credentials required. If no username and password were set when creating the
database, you can leave these fields empty and the default values will be
used.
