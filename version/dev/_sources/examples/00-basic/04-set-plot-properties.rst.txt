How to set plot properties
==========================

When working with a table, you can turn it into a plot by specifying
the plot type through the `plot` property. Once a table is converted
you can alter all sorts of plot properties by accessing properties on
the item object.

.. note::
   This example assumes that you have a local Ansys installation.

Initially, you must create and start a session as per other examples.

Start an Ansys Dynamic Reporting service
----------------------------------------

Start an Ansys Dynamic Reporting service on a new
database. The path for the database directory must be to an empty directory.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-35

.. code-block:: Python


    import numpy as np

    import ansys.dynamicreporting.core as adr

    db_dir = "C:\\tmp\\new_database"
    adr_service = adr.Service(db_directory=db_dir)
    session_guid = adr_service.start(create_db=True)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-42

Create a simple table
---------------------

Start by creating a simple table and visualizing it. Create a table
with 5 columns and 2 rows.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-49

.. code-block:: Python


    my_table = adr_service.create_item(obj_name="Table")
    my_table.table_dict["rowlbls"] = ["Row 1", "Row 2"]
    my_table.item_table = np.array(
        [["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], ["1", "4", "9", "16", "25"]], dtype="|S20"
    )


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-53

Once you have created a table, set it to be a plot by changing
its properties, and then you can set other properties.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-61

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set visualization to be plot instead of table
    my_table.plot = "line"

    # Set X axis and axis formatting
    my_table.xaxis = "Row 1"
    my_table.format = "floatdot1"


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-64

Properties can also be inspected this way.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-75

.. code-block:: Python


    print(my_table.type)

    # Close the service
    # -----------------
    #
    # Close the Ansys Dynamic Reporting service. The database with the items that
    # were created remains on disk.

    # sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_path = '_static/00_create_db_0.png'
    adr_service.stop()
