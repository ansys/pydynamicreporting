It returns the version of the\nADR Nexus\nserver API that the server is using. Note: this method will throw an\nexception on encountering an error.\n\nhas_database_url = serverobj.valid_database()\n\nThis method checks to see if a database url has been set.

If the query is\nNone, all of the GUIDs of the type specified by objtype will be\nreturned. The objtype keyword specifies the type of database object to\nget the list of guids for. Valid values for the objtype keyword include:\n\nreport_objects.DatasetREST\n\nreport_objects.SessionREST\n\nreport_objects.ItemREST\n\nobj_list = serverobj.get_objects(objtype=type_class, query=None)\n\nThis method is similar to get_object_guids() except that it\nreturns a list of actual instances of the class specified by the\nobjtype keyword instead of just returning the GUIDs.\n\nNote that if you want the list of templates, you can either set\nobjtype to report_objects.TempalteREST or to\nreport.objects.TemplateREST.factory. In the first case, all the\ntemplates will be returned as objects of the TemplateREST class. In\nthe second case, all templates will be returned as objects of the\nsub-classes of TemplateREST, corresponding to the exact report_type.\n\nobj = serverobj.get_object_from_guid(guid, objtype=type_class)\n\nThis method queries the ADR Nexus server for a single object of the class\nspecified by objtype with the GUID specified by the guid argument. It\nreturns an instance of the class specified by objtype or None if the\nGUID is not present.\n\nstatus_code = serverobj.put_objects(objects)\n\nThis method takes a collection of objects of the classes\nreport_objects.DatasetREST, report_objects.SessionREST and\nreport_objects.ItemREST and pushes the local contents of the objects to\nthe server. If objects with the same GUID(s) already exist in the server\ndatabase, they will be overwritten. The return value is a status code\nfrom the requests Python module (e.g. requests.codes.ok). Note:\nif an error occurs the method will return the last error, but it will\ntry to push every object in the input collection.\n\nstatus_code = serverobj.del_objects(objects)\n\nThis method takes a collection of objects of the classes\nreport_objects.DatasetREST, report_objects.SessionREST and\nreport_objects.ItemREST and asks the server to delete them. If objects\nwith matching GUIDs exist in the server database, they will be removed\nfrom the database. This method only looks at the guid attribute of the\ninput object collection. The return value is a status code from the\nrequests Python module (e.g. requests.codes.ok). Note: if an\nerror occurs the method will return the last error, but it will try to\ndelete every object in the input collection.\n\nstatus_code = serverobj.get_file(object, fileobj)\n\nIn some cases, a report_objects.ItemREST instance will have an\nassociated file in the Ansys Dynamic Reporting datastore.\nExamples include images,\nanimations and 3D geometry (see report_objects.ItemRest above). The\nItemREST.is_file_protocol() can be used to check for this. This method\nwill download the file (if any) associated with the (ItemREST instance)\nobject and write the output into the file object specified by the\nfileobj argument. Fileobj should be an open Python file type object that\nsupports minimally write I/O semantics. Note that the operation is\nstreaming, so it is possible for a partial file to exist if errors are\nencountered. The return value is a status code from the requests\nPython module (e.g. requests.codes.ok).\n\nsession = serverobj.get_default_session()\ndataset = serverobj.get_default_dataset()\nserverobj.set_default_session(session)\nserverobj.set_default_dataset(dataset)\n\nThe server object maintains default SessionREST and DatasetREST objects\nthat are used with the create_item() method to simplify data item\ncreation. The get_default_session() and get_default_dataset() methods\nreturn the current default session and dataset objects. The\ncorresponding set_default_session() and set_default_dataset() methods\nset these objects to externally generated objects or more commonly,\nmodified objects returned by the get methods.\n\nitem = serverobj.create_item(name=”Unnamed Item”, source=”ADR Python\nAPI”, sequence=0)\n\nThis method simplifies the generation of data items. One can create a\nnew data item by simply instantiating an instance of ItemREST(), but\nmany of the item attributes would need to be configured properly before\nthe object can be saved into the database. Most notably, the\nitem.session and item.dataset attributes need to be set to the GUIDs for\nan instance of SessionREST and DatasetREST respectively. The Server\nobject always maintains a default instance of SessionREST and\nDatasetREST objects. The object references can be modified by the user\nto customize their metadata. The create_item() method will create a new\ninstance of the ItemREST class and will automatically fill in the\nsession and dataset attributes to the objects returned by\nget_default_session() and get_default_dataset(). Additionally, if\nput_objects() is called on an item whose session or dataset attributes\nmatch the default GUIDs, the put_objects() method will push the session\nand/or dataset objects as needed. If the session/dataset objects change\n(without changing the GUIDs) the system will detect this any\nautomatically push them when the next item is pushed that references one\nof them. The create_item() method allows the user to specify the name,\nsource and sequence number for the item during creation.\n\nserverobj.export_report_as_html(report_guid, directory_name,\nquery=None)\n\nThis method exports the Ansys Dynamic Reporting report with the\nGUID specified by the\nargument “report_guid”. The result will be written into the directory\nspecified by the argument “directory_name”. The method will create the\ndirectory if it does not exist previously.

One common variation of a polar plot is a radar chart. The\ndata position is determined by:\n\nRadius (r): The distance from the center of the polar plot, defined by\nthe yaxis property.\n\nTheta (θ): The direction of the point, measured in numeric degrees or\ncategorical data, defined by the xaxis property.\n\nScatter polar is the only available polar plot type for now.\n\nThe theta (θ) value is defined by the data type of the xaxis\nvalues:\n\nIf xaxis values have minus numeric value: The labels will be a list\nof symmetrical values from “(-180°) - (180°)”.\n\nIf xaxis values are all positive values: The labeles will be from\n“(0°) - (360°)”.\n\nIf xaxis values are categorical values: All xaxis values will be used\nto label."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"examples/00-basic/03-plottype.html#close-the-service","title":"Plot types > Close the service","text":"Close the service\n\nClose the Ansys Dynamic Reporting service.
