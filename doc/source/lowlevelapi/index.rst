The low level Python API for Ansys Dynamic Reporting
allows the user to have full control of all the features
of ADR and the Nexus server. It is a very powerful API, but
at the same time it can be quite complex and requires the end user
to fully understand how ADR works in all its components. For a
full description of ADR as a package, see `Nexus`_
