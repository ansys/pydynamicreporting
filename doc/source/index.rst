Introduction
------------
Ansys Dynamic Reporting, documented as `Nexus`_, provides the report
generator technologies that are used in several Ansys products. Ansys Dynamic
Reporting allows you to collect data in multiple formats from different sources.
You can then aggregate, analyze, and display this data in highly interactive reports.

Here are some key features of Ansys Dynamic Reporting:

- Handles multiple data formats natively.
- Stores data from multiple sources, including CAD packages, simulation software, and postprocessors.
- Provides tools for aggregating, filtering, and processing the data in the database.
- Supplies a web-based interface for quickly and intuitively interacting with database items.
- Includes a template editor for generating report templates.
- Displays live reports that automatically update when new data is available.
- Generates reports with a high degree of interactivity.
